This article describe the pipeline throughly and very detailed!
I implement the get ray from this page. but didn't succeed

I want to implement the ray and the triangle collision test, I search the code
I cam across this page, I use the ray-triangle overlap code. And it worked.
BTW, this article also give me a hint that at last I use the trick depicted in
the D3D10X smaple Pick10, I modified the code and the pick woked
